# CompoChartAccessbyMashupCSV
In this task, Vidyut Sir said to me that Create a Mashup and you have to access Qlik Sense Extension Data from Qlik Sense Dashboard. You have to create a button. After clicking the button, A CSV file should have generated. The CSV file contains all data of Extension (Feild and Measures).
